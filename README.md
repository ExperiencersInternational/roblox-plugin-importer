Plugin Importer is a free plugin for Roblox that gives developers, and the curious, an easy way to grab and insert the source code of any plugin, and plop it straight into their game.

Source code imported with Plugin Importer is inserted into `ServerStorage` and will be contained within a folder named `Plugin_{{pluginId}}`. Once imported successfully, the plugin will be automatically selected in your Explorer window.

Plugin Importer is built with [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact) and [BasicState](https://github.com/ClockworkSquirrel/BasicState), and supports both light and dark modes!
